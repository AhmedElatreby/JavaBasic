package Abstraction;

// to use the IAnimal class we have to use the keyword (implements)

// However, if you don't want to use the override methods, than you have to addedd abstract tho the class for an example
// public abstract class Cat implements IAnimal {
public class Cat implements IAnimal {

    // once you implement the IAnimal class you have to add the the methods from IAnimal class
    @Override
    public void voice() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    }

    @Override
    public void NoOfLegs() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub

    }
